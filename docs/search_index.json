Abstract of Idea # 1: Suspicious Order Monitoring (MySOM) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has implemented an enforcement tool called the Suspicious Order Monitoring (SOM) requirement, as a means to address the opioid crisis. SOM requires that any DEA-registered entity that distributes opioids, or other controlled substances, must design and operate a system that discloses suspicious orders of controlled substances. MySOM is an application used by distributors of controlled substances that will flag and report suspicious orders to the DEA. It relies on order data stored by the distributors, as well as third party data related to prevalence of drug use and location of overdoses. Distributors that use MySOM maximize their revenue by fulfilling almost all legitimate orders they receive and are capable of fulfilling. They also minimize their risk of being investigated by the DEA for completing fraudulent orders, which can be extremely costly. Abstract of Idea # 2: Jury Selector Assistant (JUSAS) Humans are filled with biases, yet we call on them to serve in jury trials, and expect them to come to unbiased verdicts. Sometimes these verdicts are not correct, and people are wrongly convicted. JUSAS is a tool that collects demographic and social media data for all potential jurors, and then uses this data to select the least biased jury towards a given case. This will result in more just verdicts. Specifically, less innocent people will be convicted, and less guilty people will be set free. "],
["comply-with-som.html", "“Suspicious Order Monitoring” Compliance Application (MySOM) New DEA Enforcement Comply with MySOM Achieve Operational Efficiency", " “Suspicious Order Monitoring” Compliance Application (MySOM) New DEA Enforcement The opioid crisis has become a top public health priority in the US. It has resulted in many lost lives, increased crime and poverty, as well as depletion of government resources including: police, hospitals, rehabilitation centers and tax dollars. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has implemented an enforcement tool called the Suspicious Order Monitoring (SOM) requirement, as a means to address the opioid crisis. SOM requires that any DEA-registered entity that distributes opioids, or other controlled substances, must design and operate a system that discloses suspicious orders of controlled substances. The DEA has not provided exact guidelines on how to identify suspicious orders, so it falls on the distributors to create a model and process that flags and reports suspicious transactions. This presents a serious problem for the distributors, because revenue is sacrificed when legitimate orders are blocked, and risks are escalated when orders from pharmacies involved in illegal activity are fulfilled. If found guilty of fulfilling illegitimate orders then distributors can be hit with large fines, or even worse, lose their license to distribute controlled substances. I would like to help pharmaceutical drug distributors lower these risks, while minimizing the opportunity cost of lost revenue. Comply with MySOM In order to achieve this goal, I plan on building an application, called MySOM, that will be used by the distributors. MySOM will implement an algorithm that will classify orders as one of three possibilities: “legitimate”, “suspicious”, or “undetermined”. “Legitimate” orders will be executed. “Suspicious” orders will be automatically sent to the DEA. “Undetermined” orders will be manually reviewed by a compliance employee at the organization. The algorithm will rely on the distributor’s data, as well as publically available data related to prevalence of drug use and location of overdoses. Suspicious orders will be identified using metrics that calculate if an order is of unusual size, unusual frequency, in an area with high rates of abuse and overdoses, or deviates from normal patterns. MySOM will have an interface that will allow the user to connect to a database and map data fields to each variable required for the algorithm. Distributors will typically have a team of database administrators that I will be able to assist with the mapping process. The application will also have an interface from which manual review can be conducted, allowing the reviewer to manually flag “undetermined” orders as “legitimate” or “suspicious”. This application can be set to run as often as the user wishes, and will return the calculated classifier for each order to the database from which it came from. Achieve Operational Efficiency Once MySOM is rolled out to entities that distribute controlled substances, these distributors will be maximizing their revenue by fulfilling almost all legitimate orders they receive and are capable of fulfilling. In addition, I anticipate that no distributors using my product will be investigated by the DEA for completing fraudulent orders, if they follow the recommendations of the algorithm. I suspect the algorithm will not always be perfect, but believe the DEA will be forgiving of distributors that only make a few small errors. I would like to establish a process where a portion of my customers send us their data, enabling us to continuously improve the predicative algorithm. I also proposed a manual review element to the process that accompanies MySOM. Manual review can be prone to mistakes, and it is important that these distributors implement a standardized review process, in order to obtain consistent results. In the end, my application will allow distributors to achieve operational efficiency while they comply with the SOM requirements enforced by the DEA. If the SOM requirements effectively address the opioid crisis that impacts all of us in one way or another, then I will be proud that my application will be a part of that. "],
["automated-jury-selection.html", "Jury Selector Assistant (JUSAS) Wrongly Convicted Minimize Jury Biases Justice for All Citations", " Jury Selector Assistant (JUSAS) Keywords crime, jury, bias, innocent, exoneration, just, verdict Wrongly Convicted What if you got charged with a crime you did not commit? Do you feel comfortable that your justice system would come to the truth? Does it scare you that the reality is no justice system is perfect, and there is a chance you could be wrongly convicted? In the United States, since 1989, there have been 2,109 exonerations making up more than 18,250 years of lost life1. This does not include innocent people who are still incarcerated. It is understandable that our justice system is not perfect, because it relies on humans who are never perfect. Humans are filled with biases, yet we call on them to serve in jury trials, and expect them to come to unbiased verdicts. The U.S. government needs to do more to minimize the biases of juries that have been tasked with deciding the fate of accused citizens. Minimize Jury Biases I propose creating a jury selector assistant tool (JUSAS) that will choose juries that are more likely to decide correct verdicts, compared to juries that are chosen by humans alone. This tool will use data science to predict and minimize juror biases, using information about each person, including demographic data (age, race, sex, income, political party, region, etc.) and social media data (likes, posts, follows, groups, networks, etc.). Once a pool of potential jurors is selected, a clerk will enter the variables of the case (i.e. white male, robbery, convenience store, etc.) and run the tool which will select the overall least biased jury. JUSAS will start by eliminating any potential jurors that show a risk of strong bias towards the given case. Some examples may include: A case where a car was stolen, and the juror has posted an angry post on social media in the past indicating that their car was stolen. A case where a woman is suing a company over equal pay, and the juror is a member of many women’s rights activist groups. A case where a church was robbed, and the juror is an active member of the same church. Apple is in a lawsuit for a faulty product, and the juror has expressed their dislike of Apple products on social media. Everyone in the remaining pool of potential jurors will also have biases, but they will potentially be weaker than the jurors that have been excluded in the previous step. The tool will select the final jury from this pool, while attempting to balance and minimize the remaining biases using the data it has collected on each person. Justice for All Jurors are asked to assume the null hypothesis that a person is innocent until proven guilty. JUSAS will reduce type 1 error, which is convicting an innocent person, as well as type 2 error, which is letting a guilty person go. Type 1 error is the more important of the two errors, and could be measured over time using exoneration rates. Type 2 error is more difficult to measure, but could potentially be inferred from rates of people who have been found not guilty and proceeded to eventually commit a similar crime. JUSAS will receive a lot of scrutiny. The main issue may be that the tool itself will also have biases, because the algorithms will be developed by humans who could transfer some of their own biases. The algorithms also have the potential to develop their own biases as they continue to learn. However, I believe the tool will do a better job at selecting jurors, because it will be developed with all of this in mind. In the heat of the moment, judges, lawyers, and jurors may not be aware of their own biases. Lawyers even try to use biases to their advantage, often attempting to select jurors that will favor their side of the case. JUSAS will control for these factors in a way that will lead to less biased juries and more just verdicts. Citations 1 https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/Exoneration-by-Year.aspx "]
